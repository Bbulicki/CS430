README for CG_hw3
Description: Accept Simplified Postscript-like format file and Generate a PBM Image as Output
Note: I have included both an execuateable and python script.  Both Scripts have worked for me, in tux the python script needs to be called by ./CG_hw3.py

Program Features:
    - All Features Implemented from HW1
        - Accept Simplified Postscript-like format file and Generate a PBM Image as Output
        - If No input, script resorts to default values
        - Accepts "Postscript" file as input using -f
        - Accepts and implements Scaling factor using -s
        - Accepts and implements rotation in counterclockwise direction using -r
        - Accepts and implements x-translation by using -m
        - Accepts and implements y-translation by using -n
        - Accepts and implements x-bounds using -a (lower) and -c (upper)
        - Accepts and implements y-bounts using -b (lower) and -d (upper)
    - All Features Implemented from HW2
        - Accepts Polygon Postscript file
        - Implements Sutherland-Hodgman Algorithm to clip Polygons
    - Updated Features Implemented from HW3
        - Accept Arbitrary Number of Polygons
        - (PERFORM FILLING)
        - (DEFINE RESOLUTION)
        - 

Language: Python 3.8.5

Developed on: MacOS & Windows 
Tested on: MacOS, Tux (Proper Output was Produced)
