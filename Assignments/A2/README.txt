README for CG_hw2
Description: Accept Simplified Postscript-like format file and Generate a PBM Image as Output
Note: I have included both an execuateable and python script.  Both Scripts have worked for me, in tux the python script needs to be called by ./CG_hw1.py

Program Features:
    - Accept Simplified Postscript-like format file and Generate a PBM Image as Output
    - If No input, script resorts to default values
    - Accepts "Postscript" file as input using -f
    - Accepts and implements Scaling factor using -s
    - Accepts and implements rotation in counterclockwise direction using -r
    - Accepts and implements x-translation by using -m
    - Accepts and implements y-translation by using -n
    - Accepts and implements x-bounds using -a (lower) and -c (upper)
    - Accepts and implements y-bounts using -b (lower) and -d (upper)

Language: Python 3.8.5

Developed on: MacOS & Windows 
Tested on: MacOS, Windows, Tux (Proper Output was Produced, though pbm files could not be opened in an image form on windows)
